           == Instructions for Upgrading Netdot 0.9.10 to 1.0.x ==


1. You will need to update the database schema in addition to the application.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING

After making a backup copy of your database, please execute the following command:

    make upgrade

This will call a script that updates your current database to the schema required 
by the version you are upgrading to. This may take a long time, depending on the 
size of your database.

2. Run 'make testdeps' to make sure that you satisfy the new dependencies

3. At this point you can do a 'make install'

4. Be aware that Netdot does not include MIB files in the mibs/ directory any more. 
This helps make Netdot more tolerant of changes in the aSNMP libraries (SNMP::Info).
You will need to download the latest version of the 'netdisco-mibs' package, available
here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/netdisco/files/netdisco-mibs/

By default, Netdot expects each vendor directory in the following path:

    /usr/share/netdisco/mibs

So, for example, you can do something like:

    cd /tmp
    wget http://path-to-latest/netdisco-mibs.tar.gz
    mkdir -p /usr/share/netdisco/
    cd /usr/share/netdisco
    tar xzvf /tmp/netisco-mibs.tar.gz
    mv netdisco-mibs mibs

5. Adjust your Site.conf file to reflect some changes:

* Modify SNMP_MIBS_PATH and SNMP_MIBS_DIRS to match the actual path where
  you installed the mibs
