   status: DONE
   This includes (table)name, columnOrder, linksTo (has_a), linksFrom
   (has_many), and mainObject.

 * a generalized sorting component to present search results in
   status: DONE
   sf is working on this right now; proof-of-concept is done. see
   sortresults.html. 

 * general search
   status: IN PROGRESS
   This is partly done, but for now is waiting on the component to
   properly sort and present results.

   This still needs the following:
   - search the linksto/has_a relationships
   - break up multi word searches 
     eg. 'computing center' => 'computing' & 'center'
   - aliases 
     at&t is also known as att.  
     wou is also known as western oregon university.
   - specific table searches ?
     specify which table to search

 * update

 * create
   status: IN PROGRESS
   Still working through the click-thrus -- making sure that clicks on
   any given link or button take you to the correct page with the
   correct state.
