======================================================================

Milestone 1

  Scheduled Release Date:  30 June 2003
  Necessary Functionality:

    * Basic Functionality:
        - browse
	- search
	- view
	- update
	- delete (for now, this can mean just setting 'null' pointers)
	- create
	- main page
      Most efforts are on typical documentation needs of networks.
      Specifically, this includes:
        - Contacts
	  Customers, vendors, manufacturers, persons, departments,
	  etc.
	- Nodes
	  Site locations, devices, models, connected circuits,
	  interfaces, services, etc.

    * Consistent Style and UI Across Pages
      This includes stylesheets, general presentation, and help pages.

    * Meta Table
      A table that contains information about the database to help in
      coding upper layers of application.

    * Access Control
      For this release, we just need two locks:  one for RONLY
      permission and one for RW permission.  If needed, we can keep it
      down to one lock.

    * Node Discovery
      Some ties to allow information from NetViewer to push
      information into the database.

    * History & Timestamps

    * netdot.uoregon.edu
      Since we are referring to this host, we should set it up
      somewhere as a virtual.

  About 7 days before release, we should freeze current development
  and focus efforts on testing the impending release.
