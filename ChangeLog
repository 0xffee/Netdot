	* node.html 
	Mostly in place, just waiting for code to insert subnets (if
	necessary).  Otherwise, inserts nodes, interfaces, and ip addresses. 

	* create.html
	Updated to use GUI.pm.  New state code.  Improvements to UI.
	Minor issue as described below still exists, but this is a low
	priority.

	* updatenodes.pl
	Script for cron to run daily and update node, interface, ip, and
	subnet information.

	* create.html
	This file is now functional.  Interface is mostly there.  There
	are some lingering issues regarding a case where name field is
	filled on one page, submit is clicked, and the subsequent page has
	a name field (which is filled in with the value from the last
	page).  This is a minor issue.  Otherwise, correct state follows
	navigation. 

	* browse.html
	Basic functionality is there, with a decent looking initial page. 

	* table.html
	Component that creates an (html) table that displays all the
	objects (tables) in the database.  Finished.

	* sortresults.html
	General functionality is there.  Work is needed on the
	appearance. 

	* search.html 
	Mostly finished.  Probably have some lingering UI issues.

	* form.html
	Component for creating a <form> </form> section for a specific
	instance from a given table.  This has problems with update.html -
	the new buttons don't go to create.html.  Initial test of wrapping
	New buttons with <form action=create> didn't seem to work too
	well.  Will need more tests to evaluate this problem.

2003-04-15  netdot  <netdot@tiroloco.uoregon.edu>

	* DBI.pm:
