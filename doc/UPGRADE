           == Instructions for Upgrading Netdot 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 ==



1. You will need to update the database schema in addition to the application.

   There are no actual schema changes in this upgrade. The only thing we need 
   is to match the schema version to the application version.
	
   Please execute the following command:

    	  # make upgrade

2. Check for new requirements:

   # make testdeps

3. At this point you can do a 

   # make install [PARAMETERS]
