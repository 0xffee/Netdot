    <strong>What is a Host Name?</strong>

    <p>A host name is the unique name by which a network-attached device (which could consist of a computer, printer, file server, network storage device, fax machine, copier, etc.) is known on a network. The hostname is used to identify a particular host in various forms of electronic communication.

<p>If you are requesting an IP address, you must specify a host name for your machine. The name must be lowercase, with no spaces, special characters, or symbols. Dashes are acceptable but cannot be the first character.

    <strong>What is an Ethernet address?</strong>

    <p>The Ethernet address of a network interface card is the unique 48-bit value that identifies the card to the rest of the network. Every network card has a unique ethernet address permanently burned into its memory. These are also sometimes referred to as "physical", "hardware" or "MAC" addresses.

    <strong>Is the Ethernet address required in the host form?</strong>

     <p>Your Ethernet address is required if you want your machine to obtain its address and other settings via DHCP.  DHCP is recommended because otnetwork parameters (DNS servers, default router, etc.) are assigned and updated automatically. However, if you decide to manually configure your IP address and network settings, then you do not necessarily need to enter an Ethernet address in the host form.

     <p>
     <strong>What does an Ethernet address look like?</strong>

     <p>An ethernet address is 48-bits long. Since 48-bit patterns are hard to read -- but hexadecimal digits are easy to read -- ethernet addresses are often written using hexadecimal digits. Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 of the 48-bits, so you end up with a 12-digit hex value such as the following:

     <p>00:E1:27:A5:82:F2

     <p>
     <strong>How can I find the Ethernet address on my network card?</strong>

     <p>There are many different card vendors, and many different operating systems, and each of them may provide their own individual way to get at the ethernet address. A list of the common methods for locating the ethernet address on various platforms is given below:

       <dl>

         <p>
         <dt>On a PC running Windows

         <dd>Go to: Start Menu -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.  At the black window prompt, type:
 
         <p>'ipconfig /all' <enter>

         <p>Look for the Ethernet adapter section (usually called "Local Area Connection" and locate the line that says "Physical Address".

         <p>
         <dt>On a Mac

         <dd>Go to System Preferences -> Network -> Select the "Built-In Ethernet" card on the left.  Click on the "Advanced" button.  Select the "Ethernet" section.

         <p>
         <dt>On any machine

         <dd>You can look at the card itself (assuming it is not built into the machine). If you can see the card and it has a 12-digit hex value on it, then that value is most likely the ethernet address. If you cannot see the card, various pieces of system specific software can be used to locate the ethernet address.
