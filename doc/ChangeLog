Merging fix from trunk.

Fix for ticket #270.  Now all children of the parent block are skipped
over while searching for a free block in auto_allocate.  This also
fixes the speed issue which existed before (e.g., allocating a /17 and
then a /31 using the same strategy used to result in auto_allocate
trying all 2**(31-17) /31s which the /17 conflicted with.  This could
really get out of hand with IPv6) since the time the search takes is
now bounded by the number of preexisting children, not the number of
subnets of the requesting size which would fit in the parent.

* Worked on ticket #272 (Allow user to add IP addresses from IP section in device.html)
  Now user can add new IP addresses while at the 'IP Info' section of the device page.
  This is a partial fix because user can only create new addresses this way, but not 'assign' 
  new addresses to an interface if those exist already.
  I think we need to come up with a standardized method for adding 'has_many' objects.  This
  would be similar to the UI::select_lookup() method, which already handles the case of 'has_a' objects.
  For now, I modified the IP page to let the user change the interface it is assigned to.  
* Also found a bug in the device page that was causing jacks to not be listed when editing an interface
  if the device had a Closet assigned.
