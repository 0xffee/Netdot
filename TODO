 * Insert Meta information into the database
   status: DONE
   This includes (table)name, columnOrder, linksTo (has_a), linksFrom
   (has_many), and mainObject.

 * a generalized sorting component to present search results in
   status: DONE
   sf is working on this right now; proof-of-concept is done. see
   sortresults.html. 

 * general search
   status: MOSTLY DONE
   This is partly done, but for now is waiting on the component to
   properly sort and present results.

   This still needs the following:
   - DONE -- search the linksto/has_a relationships
   - DONE -- break up multi word searches 
     eg. 'computing center' => 'computing' & 'center'
   - DONE -- aliases 
     at&t is also known as att.  
     wou is also known as western oregon university.
   - specific table searches ?
     specify which table to search

 * update
   status: UNKNOWN

 * browse
   status: UNKNOWN

 * create
   status: TESTING
   Much of the work is now done.  Some minor bugs still remain, but
   all of the functionaltiy is there.  Does actual insertions and
   navigation is correct.

 * history table
   We need to track changes in the database.  Some sort of history
   table(s) could accomplish.  Essentially, this would be something
   similar to RCS

 * timestamps
   It'd be nice to know when a given instance was last modified.
