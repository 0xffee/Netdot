           == Instructions for Upgrading Netdot 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 ==


1. You will need to update the database schema in addition to the application.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING

This new version of Netdot fixes an incorrect UNIQUE constraint in the device
table. It is possible that your database contains two or more devices using the 
same name (RR). This means that the addition of the unique index to the device
table may fail.

After making a backup copy of your database, please execute the following command:

    # make upgrade

This will call a script that updates your current database to the schema required 
by the version you are upgrading to. 

Any errors found while applying these schema changes will be written to a file
called "error.log". You will need to inspect this file and make sure to correct
any problems before continuing. You may have to restore your database from backup,
fix the data and start over.

2. Check for new requirements:

   # make testdeps

You will notice that Netdot version 1.0.2 requires a specific version of the 
Net::Patricia Perl module. The module has been patched to satisfy our requirements,
but at the time of this writing, the patch has not been applied to the public version. 
Therefore, we have included a patched version of the module. Netdot can install it
for you by doing:

    # make installdeps

* Side Note:

There is a bug ticket open for Net::Patricia:

      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79480

It would be helpful if you could write the author of the module asking that the patch
be applied.

3. At this point you can do a 

   # make install

4. Restart Apache
