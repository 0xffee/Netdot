UPGRADING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Netdot's DB schema in general only changes in between major versions.
For example, if upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.x, you might need to run an
upgrade script.  However, if upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.8.y, it should be 
enough to run 'make install' and restart Apache

UPGRADING from 0.8.x to 0.9

2) Run 'make upgrade'
