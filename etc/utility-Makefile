# Specify the variables you would like replaced here.  The definitions
# can be specified in a make file or on the command line.

# Defaults
LIB = $(PREFIX)/lib

# Build up a list of sed expressions for the replacements.  Notice
# that undefined replacements will get flagged when replaced.

# This macro does variable substitution using sed.  It looks for
# occurrences of ``<<Make:NAME>>'' and replaces them with $(NAME),
# where NAME represents on the names specified above in REPLACEABLES.

# It behaves just like the 6 old functions which occured in various
# makefiles, that is, it installs all files in $(FILES) in
# $(PREFIX)/$(DIR) using the permissions $(FMOD).

# You call it just as you expand any other macro, i.e. $(substitute)
