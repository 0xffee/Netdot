* Back up your existing database and put it in a safe place.

	# mysqldump -c netdot > /home/dir/netdot.sql

* Copy the database with the following name:
	
	# mysqladmin create netdot-041
	# mysqldump -c netdot | mysql netdot-041

* Make sure the previous steps worked before going on!
	
* Delete the netdot database
	
	# make dropdb

* Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file to install the package.

* Run the migration script to move your old data into the new database

	# perl bin/migrate-0.4.1-to-0.5.pl

  If all goes well, the last line will read

	"Migration process finished"

  At this point you should probably restart Apache.

  If you get errors and the migration script does not complete, 
  you can probably fix the data in the old db using SQL commands
  and then try running the migration script again.

* If nothing works and you're desperate, you can always 
  reinstall netdot-0.4.1 and put back your old database in place:

	# Re-install netdot-0.4.1
	# make dropdb
	# mysqladmin create netdot
	# mysqldump -c netdot-041 | mysql netdot
	# mysqladmin drop netdot-041
