UPGRADING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Netdot's DB schema in general only changes in between major versions.
For example, if upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.x, you might need to run an
upgrade script.  However, if upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.8.y, it should be 
enough to run 'make install' and restart Apache

UPGRADING from 0.8.x to 0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Back up your database. For example, with mysql:

   # mysqldump netdot > /home/dir/netdot-bak.sql

2) Run 'make upgrade'.

3) Run 'make testdeps' to see if there are new perl module requirements.  
   If so, run 'make installdeps'.

4) Revise your netdot_apache2_(radius|ldap).conf as some declarations 
   have been added or changed
