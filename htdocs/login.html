Use the path as set in the Apache conf for the netdot root so the user
can change the location with out editing any code.  The path needs to
be absolute here since the user could pass any url and get redirected
to login (although right now the only files not at the root are the
images, and possibly a request for /netdot which I think gets
translated to /netdot/ before AuthCookie takes over anyway).
